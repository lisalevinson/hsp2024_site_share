HSP 2024 will be **hybrid**, with attendees welcome to participate
in-person in Ann Arbor or synchronously online. Plenary presentations will also be recorded and shared at a later date; other conference materials, including video walkthroughs for some posters, will be available on our [OSF Meetings page](https://osf.io/meetings/hsp2024).

## Site Information

In-person events will be hosted on the central campus of University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor, which is located in downtown Ann Arbor.

The main site will be the [Central Campus Classroom Building
(CCCB)](https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/building/central-campus-classroom-building) -
see the location on [Google
Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bptuVxVyQtbTCKGD7).

[Brief local restaurant and activity guide](resources/local-guide.pdf)

You will find many restaurants within a 10-minute walk located on South
University (two blocks south), or on North University starting at Thayer
(follow Geddes northeast, it becomes North University), and then State
Street at the end of North University.

This map shows some key locations ([PDF version](resources/hsp2024-map.pdf)):

## Accessibility and Accommodations

The conference site is fully wheelchair-accessible. All plenary presentations
will have ASL interpretation and CART captioning, available in-person
and on Zoom. The best view for ASL interpretation screens will be the front 
row, just left of center. Captions will be visible from all seats. 

Gender-neutral single-user bathrooms are available on all floors next
to the multi-user bathrooms. A 
lactation room (0510) and quiet reflection room (2510) are available - for
access see any local volunteer or organizer who can use their UM ID card to
unlock the door. Catering staff should be able to answer any questions
about food ingredients for those with special dietary needs. If you 
indicated any needs during registration that are not accounted for by 
the regular menu, you should have received an email with additional
contact information. If you have additional concerns about any access 
needs, contact the organizers at <hsp2024-conf@umich.edu>.

## Getting to Ann Arbor

### Plane

Flying into [DTW](https://www.metroairport.com/) is the most convenient
way to get to Ann Arbor by plane. From the airport, Ann Arbor is a 30
minute drive (\~\$30 - \$40 via ride share), or you can take the
[Michigan Flyer](https://www.michiganflyer.com/FaresPromotions.aspx) to
Blake Transit Center (\$25 round trip, \$15 one way).

### Train

Ann Arbor has an [Amtrak station](https://www.amtrak.com/stations/arb),
from which it is a 20 min walk or 7 min drive to campus and downtown Ann
Arbor.

## Public Transit in Ann Arbor

Our main conference site
([CCCB](https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/building/central-campus-classroom-building))
is located right next to the [CCTC (Central Campus Transit
Center)](https://tour.umich.edu/text-based/locations/central-campus-transit-center/)
bus station.

Downtown Ann Arbor and UM's central campus are very walkable areas. All
conference events will be within walking distance of each other (the
only non-CCCB event is the reception at
[UMMA](https://umma.umich.edu/)). However if you are not able to walk or
your accommodations are further from central campus, you may want to use
one of the following transportation options:

[TheRide](https://www.theride.org/)

TheRide is Ann Arbor's busing system that runs in Ann Arbor and parts of
Ypsilanti. Fares can be purchased
[in-person](https://www.theride.org/fares-passes/buy-person) at select
locations or online using the [EZfare
app](https://www.theride.org/fares-passes/mobile-ticketing). The list of
routes can be found
[here](https://www.theride.org/maps-schedules/route-maps-schedules-library).

[University of Michigan Campus
Transportation](https://ltp.umich.edu/campus-transit/routes-and-schedules/)

The University of Michigan has campus buses that are free to ride. There
are several routes across the north, central, and southern campuses. See
[this pdf of the university bus
routes](https://ltp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/university-bus-routes.pdf).

There is limited metered street parking in the conference area, but it
is generally restricted to 4-hour or 2-hour parking, and on weekdays
these limits are strictly enforced. If you are driving to the site, you
may want to use the visitor parking at [Palmer Parking
Structure](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3NLs7fg5R8NdW4w99) which is a short
walk from CCCB. [Full campus parking
information](https://ltp.umich.edu/parking/patient-and-visitor/campus-visitor-parking/)
might be useful for exploring other options. There are also city parking
lots located in downtown, but these are not as close to the CCCB.

## Accommodation

The University of Michigan has a [list of
accommodations](https://campusinfo.umich.edu/article/accommodations).
Destination Ann Arbor has a [list of hotel
packages](https://www.annarbor.org/hotels/hotel-packages/) that may be
helpful in finding accommodations.

Hotels located downtown are typically walkable to the University, but
more expensive per night. Hotels on the edges of town tend to be more
affordable per night. If you will have a car, make sure to check for
parking fees. There are also room, apartment, house, and vacation
rentals available in Ann Arbor.

The following hotels are within about a 10-minute walk from the main
conference building:

-   [Executive Learning and Conference Center
    (U-M)](https://www.acc-elandconferencecenter.com/)
-   [The Inn at the Michigan League](https://inn.studentlife.umich.edu/)
-   [The Bell Tower Hotel](https://belltowerhotel.com/)
-   [Ann Arbor Bed & Breakfast](http://annarborbedandbreakfast.com/)
-   [Graduate Hotel](http://graduateannarbor.com/)

The following hotels are also very centrally located in town, but not
quite as close to the primary conference building:

-   [Residence Inn by Marriott Ann Arbor
    Downtown](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/arbdt-residence-inn-ann-arbor-downtown)
    (23 minute walk)
