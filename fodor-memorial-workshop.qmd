The HSP community was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Janet Dean Fodor on August 28, 2023. To honor her memory, we will hold a pre-conference workshop the day before the main conference. Janet was an exceptionally influential psycholinguist, having made key contributions to our understanding of linguistic representations, sentence processing, and language acquisition. More relevant to the timing of this workshop is Janet’s role in establishing the CUNY Human Sentence Processing Conference, now known simply as the Human Sentence Processing Conference. In addition, Janet was a significant mentor to many in the field. She saw her leadership role as extending well beyond her home institution to essentially the entire psycholinguistic community, particularly early career researchers, women, and people from underrepresented backgrounds. The workshop will include presentations from many of her former mentees and main collaborators and is open to everyone attending the main conference.
